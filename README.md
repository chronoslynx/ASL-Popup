#SMARTSign - Assistant Mac
The SMARTSign-Assistant Mac application. A menubar application that allows users to search for a word through Georgia Tech's Center for Accesible Technology in Sign's (CATS) text->ASL database and then play the resulting sign.

## Current Issues
- first time the hotkey is issued the video isn't loaded

## Todos
- redesign how the interface works when multiple videos are found
    - Show video list in a column on the right of the player section
- give option for configuring hotkey
    - currently using MASShortcut for this, but having issues with the keybinding not actually happening
- give option for Menubar/normal application
