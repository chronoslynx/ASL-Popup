#SmartSign Mac
The SmartSign Mac application. A menubar application that allows users to search for a word through Georgia Tech's Center for Accesible Technology in Sign's (CATS) text->ASL database and then play the resulting sign.

## Current Issues
- first time the hotkey is issued the video isn't loaded

## Todos
- redesign how the interface works when multiple videos are found
- give option for configuring hotkey
- give option for Menubar/normal application (will take quite a bit of work)
